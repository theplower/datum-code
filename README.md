# datum-code
Project code for J6 Hackathon competition.

## Training
The model is trained using the code in *training_code.py*.

## Running the Classifier
When *hand_signs_classifier.py* is run, it is supposed that you have a PC camera plugged in to the computer, then the program captures the alphabet hand signs in front of the camera (specifically, it is assumed to be at the full width and height of the camera, in other words, the hand must be the only object in front of the camera) and prints their corresponding arabic letter.
