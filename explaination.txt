In the first we aimed to build an app to translate the fingerspelling and pronounce it.
but unfortunatly we didn't manage to make it in time.
so what we've done is just a fingerspelling classifier that classifies the signs of the arabic alphabet and print it on the console.

Thank you for your time. and for letting us have this opportunity to know about computer vision, and AI field.
